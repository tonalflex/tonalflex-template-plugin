# TonalFlex Template Plugin

---

## **üìñ Introduction**

**TonalFlex Template Plugin** provides a starting point for creating **Audio DSP Plugins** using **[JUCE](https://juce.com)** framework.

This template is designed to **simplify development** and ensure **cross-platform compatibility**, including **desktop environments** _(Linux/MacOS/Windows)_ and embedded systems such as _**[ElkOS](https://www.elk.audio/)**_.

It includes:

- **CMake presets** for standardized builds.
- **Prebuilt Docker image** to cross-compile for **[ElkOS](https://www.elk.audio/)**.
- **Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux** desktop builds.
- **Example CMake structure** for easy integration with JUCE.

Use this template to **kickstart plugin development** with minimal setup.

---

## **‚ö° Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

‚úÖ **Development Tools**:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended IDE)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (Build system)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (For cross-compilation)

‚úÖ **Additional Dependencies**:

- [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com/) (Automatically fetched via CMake)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Version control)

üí° **Tip**: Use the **CMake Presets** included in this project for an easy, consistent setup!

---

## **üéõÔ∏è Getting Started**

When opening this template for the first time:

1. **Select a CMake Preset** in your IDE.
2. The available presets are defined in [`CMakePresets.json`](./CMakePresets.json).
3. This ensures a **consistent build setup** across different environments.

---

## **üì¶ Embedded Cross-Compilation** _(ElkOS)_

Build the plugin for ElkOS using the prebuilt docker image specified in `docker-compose.yml`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Once the compilation completes, a zipped VST3 plugin for ElkOS is accessible in the workspace `output` directory.

_Note! You may need to add exectuable permission to the build script first time._

```
chmod +x ./script/build-elk-plugin.sh
```

---

## üì¶ Native WebView UI Build _(Linux/MacOS/Windows)_

From the root of the project, run:

```sh
cd ui
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This compiles the frontend and places the output in the correct directory for the plugin to include.

üí° This step is required for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).

Alternatively, you can automate this step inside a wrapper script or CI pipeline.

---

## üî® Native Build Instructions _(Linux/MacOS/Windows)_

If you want to build the plugin for desktop, use:

```sh
# Option 1 - Debug Mode
cmake -B build -S . -DHEADLESS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Option 2 - Release Mode
cmake -B build -S . -DHEADLESS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Note! For linux, you also need to specify the toolchain
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/linux-toolchain.cmake \

# Build Plugin
cmake --build build
```

_Note! Make sure you have selected a CMake Preset before first build, otherwise you may need to delete the build directory, choose preset and build again!_

### Run Desktop Standalone Plugin

After building, run:

```sh
# Debug
cd build/plugin/plugin_artefacts/Debug/Standalone

# Release
cd build/plugin/plugin_artefacts/Release/Standalone
```

```sh
# MacOS
open ./plugin.app

# Linux
chmod +x plugin
./plugin

# Windows (PowerShell)
./plugin.exe
```

### Run Desktop VST3 Plugin

To load and run the **VST3 version** of the plugin, you will need a **plugin host** such as a DAW (**Logic Pro, Reaper, Studio One, Cubase, Ableton Live, etc.**) or a standalone **VST3 plugin host** like **JUCE Audio Plugin Host** (can be built from the [JUCE library](https://juce.com)).

After building, the compiled **VST3 plugin** will be located at:

```sh
# Debug
build/plugin/plugin_artefacts/Debug/VST3/plugin.vst3

# Release
build/plugin/plugin_artefacts/Release/VST3/plugin.vst3
```

### Native Install the Plugin

Copy the **VST3 plugin** to the appropriate directory for your OS so that your DAW can detect it:

- **MacOS:** `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
- **Linux:** `~/.vst3/`

After copying, **rescan your plugins** in your DAW's settings and load the plugin.

## üöÄ CI/CD (Release) Instructions

### Release VST3 for Embedded System

_This is the headless VST3 plugin (DSP processor) that runs on the target embedded device._

```sh
# Replace v0.0.0 with actual version!
git tag v0.0.0
git push origin v0.0.0
```

_This triggers an NPM publish workflow, which builds the UI package and publishes it to the public `Tonalflex` NPM registry._

### Deploy WebUI to NPM

_This is the frontend bundle used in the embedded system‚Äôs remote UI._

```sh
# Replace ui-v0.0.0 with actual version!
git tag ui-v0.0.0
git push origin ui-v0.0.0
```

_This triggers a build workflow, which builds the plugin inside a Docker container and uploads the ZIP file to a GitHub release._
